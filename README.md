# Safety-Score
## Applied Data Science Project 2016

Social science literature has shown a strong connection between the visual appearance of a city’s streets and the behavior and health of its citizens. What makes people feel that a street is safe, and what do those perceptions tell us about different streets, neighborhoods or cities? The quality of our surroundings – is it down to the architecture, the width of the street, the amount of greenery? Or are there other, subconscious factors at play on our perceptions?
The study explores the elements of physical environment contributes to the perceived safety of the streets, neighborhoods and cities.  

**Problem Statement** 
•	How ‘Streetscore’ a measure of perceived safety relates with physical environment (building heights, street widths, lighting conditions,etc), urban physical activities (biking & walking), demographics (population density, socio-economic factors, etc ) and importantly with actual safety (crime & traffic incidents)?
The study further compares the streetscores of differ in five important cities (New York, Chicago, Boston, Philadelphia and Detroit) of United States to understand the dynamics of city’s safety.
